    <h1>Reddit's Back End: Sign Up Process Breakdown</h1>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3> Step One : The Initial Home Page </h3>
    <br>
    
<img src="assets/img/one.PNG" class="center">
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>This is the initial homepage when you first go onto reddit.com</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>From here, you can either browse, log in with an existing account, or sign up by clicking the button on the top right.</p>
 <br>
    <br>
    
    <h3> Step Two : Enter your email. </h3>
    <br>
<img src="assets/img/two.PNG" class="center">
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>After clicking sign up, it prompts you to enter your email address.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h3> Step Three : Create username and password.></h3>
    <br>
<img src="assets/img/three.PNG" class="center">
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>Create a username and password. </p>
    <br>
    
    
 <br>
    <br>
    
    <h3> Step Four : reCAPTCHA </h3>
    <br>
<img src="assets/img/four.PNG" class="center">
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>After creating a username in password, you must click off the reCAPTCHA box in order to begin the reCAPTCHA process and continue on.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>This is to prove you are not a robot.</p>
 <br>
        
    <br>
    <h3> Step Five : Your Account is created. </h3>
    <br>
<img src="assets/img/five.PNG" class="center">
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>Your account is now created. You are taken to your home screen where Reddit auto joins you and also reccomends you to communinities they believe you care to take an interest too. </p>
    <br>
    
    <p>Based on the communities it gave me, I am assuming it matched communities with topics that I might appear to be interested in based on what I have subscribed to on other websites or apps with the same email account.</p>
 <br>
        
    <br>
    <br>
     <h3> Step Six : Adding information to the site. </h3>
    <br>
<img src="assets/img/six.PNG" class="center">
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>There are several ways for you to post information on the site. To create a post you can simply click the post icon on the top right of the page or open your profile and create a new post from there. </p>
    <br>
    
    
 <br>
    
    <h3> Step Seven : Social Interactions </h3>
    <br>
<img src="assets/img/seven.PNG" class="center">
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>There are several ways to interact on Reddit. You can comment, share, or give awards on any posts you see by other users. You can also hide posts or flag them if you find the content to be inapporiate in some way. </p>
    <br>
        <p> Of course, these options also apply to anything you post as well for all the other users on the site.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3> That's about it! You should be all set now to use Reddit freely!. </h3>
